We are graphing both horizontal over time and vertical over time,
NOT vertical over horizontal or vice versa.
Also, these graph axes are seconds and meters, just not labelled yet.

Distance -- the min distance between each peak point.
    I've figured out that for Chest AA, a distance of 300 works for slow
    movements and 100 works for fast

Height -- still a mystery to me. I think it's the general height that it
searches for the peaks?
    I know that when the data starts at 0m and goes up to x meters, the
    height is x.
    But unadjusted, I had some data that went from -1.2 to -0.7 and the
    height was -0.7.
I have a feeling that once the moca and bio data is adjusted to match, the height
will be the max displacement of the movement per axis
